            <h2>-GOALS-</h2>
            <p>I hope  to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to design, develop, test, and maintain high-quality software systems that meet the needs and expectations of users and clients. As we all know software engineering is a discipline that applies engineering principles and practices to the creation of software, such as planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It also involves communication, collaboration, and management skills, as well as ethical and professional responsibilities. I strongly believe that by learning software engineering, I can gain the ability to solve complex problems, work effectively in teams, and deliver software products that are reliable, efficient, secure, and user-friendly.</p>
